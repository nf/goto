Goto - A URL shortening service

This code is the basis of the presentation 'Practical Go Programming',
available in the talk/ directory.

The accompanying code samples are in talk/code.

The code in the main directory is the full-featured URL shortener, complete
with bindings to github.com/nf/stat, a statistics-collection library.

There is a stress tester in bench/, which also depends on stat.

The demo.sh script launches the stats server (stat must be checked out and
built in ../stat), 4 goto servers (3 slaves and 1 master), and several
iterations of the stress-tester.

Run it and visit http://localhost:8090/ for a pretty graph.
